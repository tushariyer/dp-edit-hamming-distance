# dp-edit-hamming-distance
A solution to figuring out the hamming and edit distance of two inputs. Solved with Python for a class project in Intro to Bioinformatics.

Project Parameters:
The objective of this assignment is to make a single python script which uses two int lists to compute hamming and edit distances. The requirements for the int lists are to assume that s1 and s2 are int lists and |s1|=n, |s2|=m, n<=m.

Problem 1: Compute the Hamming Distance.

Problem 2: Compute the Edit Distance.

Problem 3: A Modified version of Problem 2 to hold backpointers.

Problem 4: A Modified version of Problem 2 to use O(m) memory instead of O(mn)
